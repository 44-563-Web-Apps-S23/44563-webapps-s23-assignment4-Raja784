<h4>THE LAST STRAW _Bosworth Crocker</h4>
<p>
    LANE. Say--where's the boss?

    MRS. BAUER. He'll be home soon, I--hope--Jim. What you want?

    [_He stands looking at her with growing sympathy._

    LANE. Nothin'. Got a rag 'round here? Dumb-waiter's all wet.... Lot of
    groceries for Sawyers.

    MRS. BAUER. [_Without lifting her eyes, mechanically hands him a mop
    which hangs beside the door._] Here.

    LANE. What's the matter?

    MRS. BAUER. [_Dully._] Huh?

    LANE. [_Significantly._] Oh, I know.

    MRS. BAUER. What you know?

    LANE. About the boss. [MRS. BAUER _looks distressed_.] Heard your
    friends across the street talkin'.
