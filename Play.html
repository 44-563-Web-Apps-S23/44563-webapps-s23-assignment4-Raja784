LANE. Say--where's the boss?

LANE. Nothin'. Got a rag 'round here? Dumb-waiter's all wet.... Lot of

MRS. BAUER. [_Without lifting her eyes, mechanically hands him a mop

<h6>   
LANE. What's the matter?
</h6>  
MRS. BAUER. [_Dully._] Huh?
<h6>   
LANE. [_Significantly._] Oh, I know.
</h6>   
MRS. BAUER. What you know?
<h6>
